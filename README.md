This project is all about making it easier for people to find and compare bus services through the Redbus website. We’ll automatically gather important information about both government and private buses, such as their routes, types, prices, star ratings, and available seats. By using web scraping techniques, we’ll create a simple and interactive application that helps users easily explore and filter through all this bus service data, giving them the insights they need to make informed travel choices.
